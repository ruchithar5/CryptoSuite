# CryptoSuite
CryptoSuite is a Flask-based web application designed to demonstrate the working of classical cryptographic algorithms in an interactive way. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using well-known techniques such as the Caesar Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Hill Cipher, and One-Time Pad.

The project aims to help students and beginners understand encryption principles like substitution, transposition, matrix-based encoding, and random key generation. Each algorithm is implemented with both encryption and decryption functionalities, showcasing how plaintext is transformed into ciphertext and vice versa.

The web interface provides a simple and user-friendly environment to test different keys, view outputs instantly, and learn the mathematical or logical foundation behind each algorithm.


🔐 Algorithms Implemented:

1. Caesar Cipher – Demonstrates shift-based monoalphabetic substitution.


2. Playfair Cipher – Uses digraph substitution and 5×5 key matrix generation.


3. Hill Cipher – Implements matrix-based polygraphic encryption with modular arithmetic.


4. One-Time Pad – Uses random key generation for theoretically unbreakable encryption.



⚙ Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Backend: Python (Flask Framework)

Libraries: NumPy (for Hill cipher), os (for random key generation)


🎯 Outcome:

CryptoSuite helps visualize how different encryption methods protect data and introduces users to core concepts of modern cryptography, such as key dependency, randomness, and modular arithmetic, in a simple, interactive manner.
